# Music web app!!

# How to edit
Run "npm i" in the root directory, the backend and frontend directories. 
To execute the program, you need to run both the backend and frontend. 
2 ways of doing so, individually or concurrently.
Individually:
1. In backend run "npm run server"
2. In frontend run "npm start" 
Concurrently:
1. In root run "npm run dev"
2. If it doesn't work make sure "concurrently" is installed, "npm i concurrently"

Make sure the backend has a ".env" file, PM me for the details.
